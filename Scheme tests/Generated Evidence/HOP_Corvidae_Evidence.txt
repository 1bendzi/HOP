*Accessibility WORDING: *
Accessibility
It is vital that websites are accessible to everyone - not only does it make good business sense, but it is also a legal requirement for businesses and organisations to make reasonable adjustments to provide accessible services or information.
One of the main goals of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to make the web accessible to all by promoting technologies that take into account the vast differences in culture, languages, education, ability, material resources, access devices, and physical limitations of users on all continents.
We are also in the process of applying for WAI certification via the Shaw Trust.
For further information about W3C, visit www.w3.org.
